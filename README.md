River Runners is a single player auto-scroller adventure game developed for PC. The player plays against the rapid currents of the river while controlling a log and a merry band of animals, attempting to avoid the various obstacles that appear along the way.

Furthermore, the game has both a narrative story driven mode where the player meets the different characters and is introduced to their abilities, as well as the meaning of their journey, and an endless mode that starts the player off with all abilities unlocked, and increases in difficulty over time, randomly generating modules that bring a sense of randomness to each session the player goes through.
