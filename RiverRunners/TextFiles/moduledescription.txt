#File used to describe modules to be built
#Difficulty is used to define how easy we want the level to be (a level with difficulty 3 will only use modules with difficulty 0-3)
#Group is used to control more precisely which modules to use or not without using individual ids, by default modules belong to group 0
#Negative groups will not be used on the level generation
#Groups will probably be used to define which abilities are required for that module
#
#Should use following structure: 
#
#Difficulty: 3
#Group: 2
#{
#-----
#-x---
#----x
#x----
#}
#
#Character crosses the module from the bottom up (so that this representation is closer to the actual in-game module)
